Let the wild leopards of the wood
Put off the spots that nature gives,
Then may the wicked turn to God,
And change their tempers and their lives.

As well might Ethiopian slaves
Wash out the darkness of their skin,
The deed as well might leave their graves,
As old transgressors cease to sin.

Where vice has held its empire long,
'Twill not endure the least control;
None but a power divinely strong
Can turn the current of the soul.

Great God! I own thy power divine
That works to change this heart of mine;
I would be formed anew, and bless
The wonders of creating grace.</Content><Url>https://www.poemist.com/isaac-watts/hymn-160</Url><Author>Isaac Watts</Author><Distance>0.639785106557988</Distance><People><Id>2</Id></People></Poem><Poem><Id>2</Id><Title>Time</Title><Content>Look around for time 
It's a secret that's created in your mind 
Just think: you're not blind 
Time moves day to night 
What time can do, it's out of sight Wait around depending on time 
it will slip away if you don't mine 
Each day the world turns around 
You know not where lies the existance of time 
Just know it moves onward bound Woe unto man who try wasting time 
When needed its not there from him to find 
Your days may be filled with other things 
Don't be fooled time waits on no man   My First Born I looked at my first born 
I was filled with smiles 
My mother looked at me and shook her head in style 
Her words, she is on your lap 
one day she will be on your heart child. 
I looked at her and smiled 
After she had grown up 
plenty days I wept inside 
My mother is gone, but she never lied 
Today my prayers go out to the fathers and mothers 
of the slain children of Columbine High. 

  COLUMBINE OH Columbine High 
OH Columbine High 
A mark is left but it's not mine 
Tragedy struck, broadcast all over the news 
OH Columbine High  
OH Columbine High 
It's not the school saying their goodbyes I keep wondering where those grands are tonight; 
Keep praying they will get home safe, be alright. 
Can you all hear a grandmother's plea? 
Come home while its day, be with me. 
but greiving parent with tears in their eyes 
looking down on their children laid side by side. Let us pray, oh let us pray 
That the sins of this world be washed away 
Pray, pray again that this tragedy never takes place. 
Keep praying that the children left at Columbine will be safe.</Content><Url>https://www.poemist.com/sarah-lee-tyus/time</Url><Author> Sarah Lee Tyus</Author><Distance>0.61940708207143425</Distance><People><Id>4</Id></People></Poem></Poems></ResponseGetPoems>
