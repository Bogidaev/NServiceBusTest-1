 in order to cheer
 Is better than lips
 that only can sneer
 A kindly word spoken
 to a friend, stranger of foe
 leads to a better path forward
 through lifetime to go
 Care for the loneliest
 who only know strife
 let them experience
 some joy in their life.
 You lose nothing by giving
 a kindly word, friendly smile
 You'll find you get deeper meaning
 to a life that's worthwhile.
 So reap a rich harvest
 with the kindnesses you have sown
 making other lives happy
 as well as your own.</Content><Url>https://www.poemist.com/denis-pyle/to-give-is-to-receive</Url><Author> Denis Pyle</Author><Distance>0.33643979447919492</Distance></Poem><Poem><Id>2</Id><Title>Proving False</Title><Content>News runs faster 
than the sun. It is 
dark already.

You have started arresting 
the shadows. I was still 
talking to a rose.

Let's go somewhere. Where 
no war cries are heard 
for a day.

How many, will youâ€• 
count the dead? Each mortal 
wants to go home.

The postcards, don't 
arrive from the front 
anymore.

Will you take my message 
by the severed head.</Content><Url>https://www.poemist.com/satish-verma/proving-false</Url><Author>Satish Verma</Author><Distance>0.35463003086225808</Distance></Poem></Poems></ResponseGetPoems>
